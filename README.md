# Simple TFTP Server
The goal is to build a simple TFTP server that only stores files in memory.  Thereâ€™s no need to write out files.  For more information on the TFTP protocol check out the RFC:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1350

# Running it
* Clone git@github.com:AToner/go_tftp.git
* Make sure you're in the same directory as the source files
* Run the tests "go test"
* Run the real thing "go run tftp.go"
